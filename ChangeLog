04/March/2021

Initial instance of package.
Version 0.0-1.

04/March/2021

Amended the code to allow the permutations to be effected by
permuting residuals in the case of one-way anova and that of testing
for a main effect, as well as testing for an interaction
Introduced a new argument "permtype" specifying which sort
of permutation (residuals or data) should be used.

Added a vignette providing mathematical expressions for the
test statistics used.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-2.

Made a slight tweak to the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-3.

09/March/2021
Corrected a stupid error that I had made in calculating the residuals
to be permuted.  These must be residuals from null model and I was
calculating residuals from the full model.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-4.

15/March/2021
Amended the code to accept as input ("datObj") a list of numeric vectors
to be interpreted as K-functions.  Note that in this case "datObj" must
have an attribute "r" serving as the argument of these K-functions.

Note that these putative K-functions may actually be *scalars* (which
allows "ordinary" analysis of variance to be conducted).  In this case
the "r" attribute must also be a scalar (and is arbitrary).

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-5.

21/March/2021
Added a new version of kanova() (kanova2()) with a substantially
altered data structure and procedure for effecting the permutations.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-6.

20/February/2023
Replace kanova() by kanova2().

Substantially revised and debugged.  Corrected the (essentially backwards)
indexing of the data.

Added an argument "studentize", defaulting to TRUE, permitting the
user to *NOT* studentize the test statistic.  This argument was
added basically to permit the comparison of the test statistic with
one that can be computed in a simple-minded manner in the case of
scalar "K functions".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-7.

26/February/2023
Adjusted kanova() to use a formula argument.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-8.

27/February/2023
Copied kanova.R to kanovaDB.R (making kanovaDB() an internal
function) and got rid of the studentize argument from kanova().
WTF does "DB" mean?  Said he on 15/May/2023.  Perhaps "debug"?

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-9.

15/May/2023

Started adjusting the residuals to be "standardised" residuals, in
the hope that this may enhance exchangeability when the permutation
test is conducted by means of permuting the residuals.

05/June/2023
Realised that I need to get my head together on the resulting Studentisation
variance.  Re-wrote the vignette testStat.ltx.

05/July/2023
Extensive revision of the kanova function completed.  It is now
assumed that under the null hypothesis (of no group effect[s]) the
variance of the K-function associated with a pattern X is equal to
sigma^2/m where m is the number of points in X.  The calculation
of the test statistic becomes thereby much cleaner and to some
extent simpler.  Estimates of K-functions are now calculated as
weighted means of individual K-functions, with the weights being
the numbers of points in the associated patterns. See the vignette
"testStat" for more discussion.

Eliminated the auxiliary functions kanovaEngine(), permDatMat()
and statPrep().  Added auxiliary functions permSumFns(), resAndFit(),
testStat(), and wtdMeans().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-10.

05/July/2023
Revised initPrep() so that, if desired, the names of the levels of
the classification factors can be "simplified".  This is effected
by giving kanova() a new argument "simpNms".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-11.

25/04/2024
Modified kanova() so that if "fmla" involves a variable not found
in "data" then that variable is looked for in parent.frame().  If
it is still not found, then an error (with an appropriate message)
is thrown.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-12.

01/05/2024
Modified the structure so that the data must *alway* be a hyperframe.
The response column of this hyperframe is now allowed to be a list of
numeric vectors (the ostensible summary functions of point patterns),
and not just a list of point patterns.  Made numerous adjustments
to kanova.R and initPrep.R.  Got rid of the "simNms" and "iperm"
arguments to kanova().  Added a "brief=TRUE" argument to kanova();
if "brief" is FALSE, then a more elaborate object is returned.
Added an "EffectName" component to the list being returned.
Made "Tstar" a component of the list being returned, when "brief"
is FALSE (rather than an attribute created when "keepsimstats"
is TRUE (and got rid of the argument "keepsimstats").

Added examples to the kanova help file, illustrating the scenario
in which the response is a list of numeric vectors.  Also an example
in which these numeric vectors are actually scalars.  (Example taken
from the Devore7 package; the DESCRIPTION file now suggests Devore7.)

Substantial change, so incremented the minor version number.

05/05/2024
Corrected a typo (Pseudi |--> Pseudo) in the DESCRIPTION file.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-1.

17/05/2024
Corrected major (conceptual!) bug w.r.t. creation of the mean summary
functions and the studentising variances. Revised the way these means
and variances are stored --- put them into "data", where they should
have been put all along!

05/06/2024

The foregoing "Revised the way ..." is not actually correct. The mean summary
functions and the studentisation have however been corrected.

Fixed various bugs/glitches in testStat().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-3.

30/06/2024

Revised builds2Khat(), fixing various (major!) glitches.
Introduced the logical argument do.s2; if this is FALSE, s2
does not get calculated.  Discontinued use of wtdMeans() --- which
wasn't being used correctly --- and replaced calls to wtdMeans()
with calls to builds2Khat(...,do.s2=FALSE)

Fixed a bug in resAndFit() (when "type" was equal to "interac",
tried to extract Khat from iDat; no such component any longer;
never should have been there).

04/07/2024

Fixed same bug (!!!) when type was equal to "oneway".

Revised the "testStat" vignette a bit.

19/07/2024
`
Further fiddling with the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-4.

21/07/2024

Changed email address to my posteo address, in the DESCRIPTION
file.  Changed "anova" to "Anova" in the title (should be in
title case).  Wrapped a bit of the kanova() examples in \dontrun{}
to reduce the time a bit.  (Winbuilder said the toadal time was
12.14 > 10.00 seconds.  I get only 8.927 seconds in my timing
calculations. (???) Irrespective of that,  I cut a bit out.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-5.

25/07/2024

Further tweaks to the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-6.

03/08/2024
Adjusted the vignette structure so that the package would build
under rhub, by using the "asis" concept from the R.rsp package.
The vignette directory now holds vignetteForTestStat.pdf and
vignetteForTestStat.pdf.asis.

Created a directory preVignettes, parellel with vignettes, to
hold the components (kanova.bib, testStat.ltx) from which the file
vignetteForTestStat.pdf, in the vignettes directory, can be built.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-7.

12/08/2024
Added the function ripVar() to calculate the variance of the
K-function of a Poisson process.  (Was intending to make use of
this function in calculating the test statistics, but since the
procedure is only valid for Poisson processes I decided that this
was pointless.)

13/08/2024
Added the arguments "expo" and "rsteps" to kanova() and to
initPrep().

Adjusted the initPrep() code so that the length of the "r" argument
to the summary function is rsteps+1 (where rsteps defaults to 128).
Rather than (in the case of Kest()) being hard-wired to 513.
Adjusted the code so that the "r" argument consists of values on the
interval [0,rtop] where rtop is calculated by rmax.rule().  So the
code now works for all four summary functions, not just for Kest().

Edited the vignette to reflect the current state of affairs.

Added some remarks on fitted values and residuals (mainly via
reference to the vignette) to the help for kanova().

Changed the syntax for specifying the name of the summary function.
It is no longer required to be one of "Kest", "Fest", "Gest" or
"Jest".  This may be a bit, uh, fragile. If left NULL the name
defaults to "Kest".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-8.

22/08/2024
Made "r" an (optional) argument of kanova(), defaulting to NULL.
If left NULL then the default value of r is created as it was
previously.

Modified the help accordingly.

Added comments to the help to the effect that users should exercise
caution in using summary functions other than Kest().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-9.

30/08/2024
Added an argument "repairJ" to kanova().  If this is TRUE, then
NAs that appear in the results from Jest() are replace by values
obtained by means of interpolating splines (with "method" equal
to "natural").  This argument is of course ignored unless sumFnNm
is "Jest".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-10.

30/08/2024
The "repairJ" idea (above), using interpolating splines, did not
work.  Changed the "repair" process to the following:

    * find the largest index imax so that no NAs appear in the
      summary functions at r[1:imax]
    * replace "rtop" by r[imax]
    * recalculate the summary functions

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-11.

01/09/2024
The whole "repairJ" schtick seems useless.  Backed it out and returned
to square 1.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-12.

05/09/2024 to 18/09/2024
Corrected a *MAJOR* bug/error in  the calculation of the
variances used in the studentization procedure.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-1.

23/09/2024
Results still anomalous.  Realised that (when the levels of B
differ in variance) permutations to test y ~ A+B vs. y ~ A need to
be done *within* the levels of B.  Even when it is residuals that
are being permuted.  Used permtype="data", which accommodates the
"permute within" requirement.   The results are good.  Need to
adjust permtype="resids" to do the permutation within the levels
of B.  This should be do-able.  There is now, however, a problem
with testing y ~ A*B vs. y ~ A+B which calls for permuting within
the levels of A *and* within the levels of B which results in all
T_i^* being equal to T_obs.  So something else needs to be done.

Revised code to permute the residuals within the levels of B,
Wrote "oEngine.R".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-2.

28/09/2024
Experimenting with permuting residuals within the levels of B,
I found (I think!) problems with permWithin().  After much struggle
and confusion, and an appeal to R-help, I have revised permWithin().

02/10/2024
In initPrep.R, coerced the response to be a list. (It *could* be
a numeric vector, in which case setting the "weight" attribute of
its entries doesn't work.)

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-3.

03/10/2024
Fixed egregious bug in the resAndFitCmpnts.R  resAndFit.R  code.
(Had been useing the K_{i..}-bar values as the fitted values,
and not the K_{.j.} values as should have been done.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-4.

03/10/2024 -- 08/10/2024
Implemented the "permute standardised residuals" idea.  Eliminated
permtype="resid" which actually makes no sense. (Has same impact
as permtype="data".)  Added functions:

buildM()
buildV()
iEngine()
teeZed()

made minor adjustments to:

resAndFitCmpts()
resAndFit()
oEngine()
aEngine()
getWts()

and made major adjustments to

formS2()
permSumFns() .

Eliminated function formS2j() (its capabilities were incorporated into
formS2().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-5.

21/10/2024
Fixed the stupid bug of effectively getting the "SSE" wrong.  I.e.
I had been, in some instances at least, using residuals from the
null model r.t. from the saturated model.

Fixed a bug (confusion of "fitz" --- fitted values from the null model
--- and "sfitz" --- fitted values from the saturated model.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-6.

23/10/2024
Changed name of formS2() to estVar(); added an argument satMod=FALSE.
Fixed a bug --- the values of "fitz" were not matching up properly
with the values of "sfitz" and "rez"; sdloc (in permSumFns()) was
NULL because the names of sd were wrong and not matching up with
those of fV.  Wrote a new function enlist() to effect the foregoing
bug fix

23/10/2024
Changed name of formS2() to estVar(); added an argument satMod=FALSE.
Fixed a bug --- the values of "fitz" were not matching up properly
with the values of "sfitz" and "rez"; sdloc (in permSumFns()) was
NULL because the names of sd were wrong and not matching up with
those of res and/or fV.  Wrote a new function enlist() to effect
the foregoing bug fix.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-7.

23/10/2024
Changed name of estVar() to estSigsq(); there's an estVar()
function in the stats package.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-8.

25/10/2024.
Fixed the loony in buildV.R, that I'd spotted in the scalars-only version.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-9.

28/10/2024
Adjusted code to accommodate the "unorthodox" model y ~ B + A*B.
Changed the name of enlist() to reenlist() :-).

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-10.

30/10/2024
Added (auxiliary) function datagensto() to generate artificial data,
based on the stomata data.

05/11/2024
Added argument "seed" to function datagenkv() ("seed" becomes an attribute
of the returned value).

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-11.

07/11/2024
Adjusted kanova() to give provide the appropriate "Effect name" when
an unorthodox test is used.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-12.

08/11/2024
Added arguments meansonly=FALSE and peturbLayer=0 to the
undocumented function datagensto().
Fixed the bug of not setting the seed in datagensto().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-13.

09/11/2024
Fixed bug in datagensto() (had left an bit of code, that did not
use perturbLayer, lying around).

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-14.

10/11/2024
Made numerous adjustments to kanova.Rd

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-15.

11/11/2024
Corrected a typo in kanova.Rd ("permtype defaults to "resperm" changed
to "permtype defaults to "stdres").

12/11/2024
Made corrections and adjustments to kanova.Rd, in respect of the
discussion of weights.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.2-16.

17/11/2024
Major revision, straightening out my previous confused thinking
in respect of the additive model.  Got rid of the "unorthodox"
model concept.  Corrected some miss-statements, errors and
confusion in the help files.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-1.

21/12/2024
Added the capacity for kanova() test for an A effect within each
level of B.  New argument bylevel=FALSE.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-2.

31/12/2024
Made (yet more) revisions to the functions for calculating the variances
of numerators in the test statistics.  Hoping like mad that I have
at last got it right.

Rewrote the testStat vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-3.

12/03/2025

Fixed egregious bugs in buildV.R:

--- added a missing 2/sum(wtm) in mult1
--- got rid of spurious factor of sum(wtm[i,]) in mutl2
--- got rid of spurious factor of sum(wtm[,j]) in mutl3

Also got rid of spurious "+" at the beginning of the second
line of the mult1 code (although it did not seem to do any
real harm.  But note that getting rid of the "+" at the end
of the first line of the mult2 code *really* fucks things up
(since then the first line is syntactically completen whence
the second line is ignored:

        mult1 <- 1/wtm[i,j] - 2/sum(wtm[i,]) - 2/sum(wtm[,j])+
                                  + 2*wtm[i,j]/(sum(wtm[i,])*sum(wtm[,j]))

Now (finally, at long last) the theoretical variance expression used in
buildV.R agrees "reasonably" with an empirical (simulation based) check
on the variance.

Corrected the testStat vignette (in respect of the bugs noted above.
Made some other modifications which rendered the vignette a bit more
coherent.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-4.

13/04/2025

Fixed another error in the Author field in the DESCRIPTION file;
the ORCID needs to be included, as in:

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-7.

Corrected errors in kanova.Rd
Removed \dontrun{} from the articial data example in kanova.Rd.

Removed else{} clauses following if(require(<package>)), so no
errors get thrown if the required package is not available.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.3-12.
